PhunnyTanks - fun kinda physics game!
Made in Unreal Engine 5.3; includes Voxel Free plugin.

List of current features:
- Controlled tank with custom suspension physics to be able to navigate in voxel world;
- projectiles with SFX and VFX (currently only 1 type);
- widgets for main menu, pause menu and in-game HUD for debug; also GUI for game start and winning\losing conditions;
- turrets as enemies, which can target and shot down player;

Features are on the way:
- better UI, in main menu and in-game HUD
- voxel destructible world;
- different projectile types;
- probably different firing system, something like hold&n&release
